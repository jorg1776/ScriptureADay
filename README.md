Displays a scripture every day in a Windows notification.

This project uses JSON files of the scriptures from https://bencrowder.net/mormon/scriptures-in-json/ to parse and find specific scriptures.

This project is connected to a mySQL database that stores the references of good scriptures from which it selects a random scripture and 
uses the reference information to parse through JSON file and extract scripture text.
